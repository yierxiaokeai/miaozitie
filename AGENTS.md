# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repo is a static, browser-only Chinese writing/learning practice site for elementary students. `index.html` is a dedicated navigation homepage (card grid linking to every tool); it has no practice UI of its own. Each tool lives in its own page in the root:
- `bihua.html`: stroke-by-stroke practice (originally `index.html`; renamed when the homepage became a nav page).
- `zice.html`: interactive handwriting self-quiz using Hanzi Writer's `quiz()` API (draw-and-check, not just animation).
- `chaozi.html`: compact copy mode for articles.
- `pinyin.html`: article pinyin annotation.
- `moxie.html`: "read the pinyin, write the character" printable dictation sheet (complements `pinyin.html`'s character-to-pinyin direction).
- `tingxie.html`: spoken dictation practice (speech synthesis + printable answer sheet).
- `mingtie.html`: name sticker/label generator.
- `kousuan.html`: mental-math drills (numpad / handwriting recognition via `tf.min.js` + MNIST model in `mnist-model/` / voice input).
- `yunsuanbiao.html`: multiplication/addition/subtraction reference tables, optionally with randomly blanked cells for fill-in practice, printable.
- `shizhong.html`: analog-clock time-reading practice (interactive quiz + printable worksheet); clock faces are pure CSS/JS (rotated divs), no canvas/SVG/library dependency.
- `gushi.html`: printable classical-poem cards (recite mode with auto pinyin via Pinyin Pro, or blank-line dictation mode); poem text is hardcoded curated public-domain content — double-check exact wording against a reliable source before adding more poems.
- `kechengbiao.html`: class timetable generator; the generated table cells are plain `<input>` fields the user types directly into (no per-subject data model).
- `renminbi.html`: RMB "make the amount" interactive drill (click denominations to match a random target); amounts are tracked internally in 角 (jiao) integer units to avoid floating-point issues.
- `xingjinzi.html`: multiple-choice quiz for commonly-confused look-alike characters (形近字), e.g. 己/已/巳, 做/作/坐/座, 燥/躁/操/澡; question bank (66 items as of this writing) is hardcoded curated content — verify sentence grammar and character correctness carefully before adding more items, and run the "extract questionBank + validate" style check (blank count, unique 4 options, answer present, single-hanzi options, no duplicate sentences) after edits.
- `ai-zhushou.html`: **experimental**, the only page that breaks the "no build step, few-MB dependencies" pattern. Its job is now narrow: show the size/license/device warnings, load the model via `ai-engine.js`, and provide a simple multi-turn chat debug window to sanity-check the model. It does NOT implement task-specific generation features itself anymore — those live in the individual tool pages that use them (see `ai-engine.js` below).
- `ai-engine.js`: shared ES module (imported via `<script type="module">`, not npm) that owns all Transformers.js / MiniCPM state: `loadAIModel()` (memoized pipeline load, no duplicate downloads), `generateWithAI(messages, options)` (one-shot chat-style generation), `supportsWebGPU()`, and `hasModelBeenLoadedBefore()` (a `localStorage` flag set after any successful load, used by other pages to decide whether to show their "🤖 AI 辅助生成" UI or a "go load it first" link). It imports `@huggingface/transformers` directly from the jsDelivr CDN and runs a community ONNX export of MiniCPM5-1B (`Mike0021/MiniCPM5-1B-ONNX-Web`, ~500MB+ q4-quantized, not an official onnx-community export) fully client-side via WebGPU/WASM. The model is fetched at runtime from the Hugging Face Hub — it is intentionally NOT committed to this repo or bundled into the Pages deploy, both because of its size and because Cloudflare Pages caps individual assets at 25 MiB. The `MODEL_ID` constant inside this file is the single point to update if the community export disappears or a better one appears.
  - **Known gap in this community export**: its `tokenizer_config.json` does not include a `chat_template`, so calling the pipeline with a `messages` array directly fails with `apply_chat_template()` errors. `generateWithAI()` works around this by manually formatting `messages` into MiniCPM5's ChatML-style prompt string itself (`<|im_start|>{role}\n{content}<|im_end|>\n`, ending with `<|im_start|>assistant\n`) and calling the pipeline with that plain string + `return_full_text: false`, instead of relying on `apply_chat_template`. It also auto-appends `/no_think` to the last user message (unless the caller already wrote `/think` or `/no_think`) so MiniCPM5 skips its default long "thinking" reasoning mode — appropriate for short, latency-sensitive browser generations. If you change the model or find an export with a working chat template, this workaround can likely be simplified back to passing `messages` directly.
  - **q4 quantization is effectively GPU-only**: some of the 4-bit ops used by q4-quantized ONNX exports (e.g. `GatherBlockQuantized`) only have WebGPU kernels, not WASM/CPU ones — so a device with no usable WebGPU adapter may fail to run this model at all, not just run it slowly. `supportsWebGPU()` (sync, checks only `'gpu' in navigator`) is kept for the actual `device` selection in `loadAIModel()`, but it is NOT a reliable performance signal — it doesn't detect fallback (software) adapters, and it can't distinguish an integrated GPU (核显, meaningfully slower for a 1B model) from a discrete one. Use the async `detectGPUAdapter()` (calls `requestAdapter()` + `requestAdapterInfo()`) for any user-facing diagnostics/expectations messaging, as done in `ai-zhushou.html`'s device status line.
  - **`detectGPUAdapter()` is timeout-guarded (via the internal `withTimeout()` helper)**: on some mobile browsers, `navigator.gpu.requestAdapter()` / `adapter.requestAdapterInfo()` have been observed to hang indefinitely (neither resolving nor rejecting), which previously froze the "正在检测设备加速能力..." status text forever. The whole detection now gives up after 4s (2s for the inner adapter-info call) and returns `{ available: false, timedOut: true }` instead of hanging. Any new async device/capability probing added to this file should get the same treatment — don't `await` a browser API here without a timeout wrapper.
  - **Mobile reality check (observed via real-device testing, not just theory)**: Safari on iOS was reported to still hang at the device-detection step even with the above timeout in place (root cause unconfirmed — possibly the main thread being blocked, or the module script failing before that timeout code even runs), so `ai-zhushou.html` layers a second, fully independent watchdog (`raceTimeout()`, 6s) around the `detectGPUAdapter()` call at the call site, not just inside `ai-engine.js`. Separately, mobile Chrome was observed to auto-reload the tab right after finishing the ~500MB+ download (almost certainly an OOM kill from ONNX Runtime/WebGPU buffer allocation during model instantiation on constrained phone RAM — this is a hardware ceiling, not something fixable in JS). To make this failure mode legible instead of silently confusing, `ai-zhushou.html` sets a `sessionStorage` flag (`miaozitie_ai_load_attempt_inflight`) right before calling `loadAIModel()` and only clears it on a clean success or a clean caught error; `checkPreviousCrash()` runs on every page load and, if it finds the flag still set, shows a "this looks like it crashed from low memory last time" hint. There's also a `.warning-box` `<li>` (`#mobileWarning`) shown only on mobile UAs, and `overscroll-behavior-y: contain` on `<body>` to reduce the odds of an accidental pull-to-refresh mid-load. None of this makes the model reliably runnable on phones — it just turns silent, confusing failures into an honest "this probably won't work well here" message.
- Pages that integrate an "AI 辅助生成" mini-feature (currently `tingxie.html` and `moxie.html`, both in their "自定义内容" tab): each adds its own `<script type="module">` that imports from `./ai-engine.js`, calls `hasModelBeenLoadedBefore()` on load to render either a locked hint (linking to `ai-zhushou.html`) or a small generation form, and re-renders on the `storage` event so other already-open tabs pick up a just-completed model load without a manual refresh. Treat all generated output as an unreviewed draft only (small 1B model, weak instruction-following) — keep the "please review before use" framing if you touch these blocks. Follow this same pattern if adding AI-assist to more pages, rather than re-implementing model loading locally.
- Model license reminder (applies to both files above): OpenBMB's General Model License — free for research, requires registration for commercial use. Keep the license link/warning visible in `ai-zhushou.html`.
- `clearAIModelCache()` in `ai-engine.js`: clears the downloaded model files from the browser. Tries the official `ModelRegistry.clear_pipeline_cache('text-generation', MODEL_ID, { dtype: 'q4' })` API first (auto-detects which files belong to this model/dtype); if that import/API isn't available in the pinned CDN version, falls back to manually opening the `'transformers-cache'` Cache Storage and deleting entries whose URL contains `MODEL_ID`. Always resets the in-memory `generatorPromise` and the `hasModelBeenLoadedBefore()` localStorage flag afterwards, so every page's "already loaded" detection stays consistent with reality. Exposed as a "🗑️ 清理模型缓存" button in `ai-zhushou.html` (with a `confirm()` prompt, since it forces a ~500MB+ re-download on next use).

Shared files, used across multiple pages (a deliberate exception to "inline everything", see below):
- `common.css`: shared header/back-link/footer styles for every tool page (not used by `index.html`, which has its own standalone hero + card styles).
- `ziku-data.js`: shared `gradeChars`/`allChars` character-bank data, used by `bihua.html`, `tingxie.html`, `zice.html`, and `moxie.html`.
- `hanzi-writer.min.js`, `pinyin-pro.min.js`, `tf.min.js`, `ziku.txt` (character data reference).

Every tool page's header only shows a single "← 返回首页" link back to `index.html`; there is no longer a multi-page nav bar. Deployment notes are in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
There is no build step or package manager. Open the HTML files directly in a browser, starting from `index.html`.
For local testing with relative assets, a simple static server is fine:
- `python -m http.server 8000` (then visit `http://localhost:8000/`)

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Indentation: 4 spaces in HTML, CSS, and JS blocks (match existing files).
- Keep styles and scripts inline within each HTML page unless there is a clear reuse case (e.g. `common.css`, `ziku-data.js` — shared across multiple pages, extracted to avoid drift/duplication).
- File naming: lowercase, short, descriptive (e.g., `pinyin.html`).
- Avoid reformatting minified vendor files (`*.min.js`) unless intentionally updating them.

## Testing Guidelines
No automated tests are configured. Validate changes manually:
- Load each page and exercise key actions (character input, pinyin toggle, print layout).
- Verify print layouts in the browser print preview for A4 single/dual column modes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent commits are short, descriptive, and often in Chinese; some use prefixes like `style:`. Follow that pattern and keep messages focused (one change per commit where possible).
PRs should include:
- A brief description of the change and the affected page(s).
- Manual testing notes (what you clicked/printed).
- Screenshots or print-preview captures for any UI or layout changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
This is a static site with no secrets or runtime configuration. Keep external dependencies pinned to local files or vetted CDN versions, and note version changes in the PR description.
